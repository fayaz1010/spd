## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS

### Why Gemini Over OpenAI?
- **Cost**: $0.075 vs $1.50 per 1M tokens (20x cheaper)
- **Speed**: Gemini 2.0 Flash is faster
- **Quality**: Comparable for most CRM tasks
- **Fallback**: System auto-falls back to OpenAI if Gemini fails

### CRM Architecture Decisions
- **Dual Pipeline**: Kept existing Lead Status (13 stages) + Deal Stage (8 stages)
- **Activity Tracking**: Unified model for all communications
- **Auto-Assignment**: Configurable with multiple strategies
- **Mobile-First**: All UIs work on phones without dedicated app

### Integration Strategy
- **Start Simple**: Manual logging first, automation later
- **API-First**: All features have REST APIs
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic features work, advanced features enhance
- **Fallback Gracefully**: If AI fails, manual options available
