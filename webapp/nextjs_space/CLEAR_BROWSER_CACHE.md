# How to Clear Browser Cache

## The Problem
Your browser has cached the old pages. Even though we've disabled server-side caching, the browser still has the old HTML/CSS/JS files cached.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Clear Browser Cache Manually (Recommended)
**In Chrome/Edge:**
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete`
2. Select "Cached images and files"
3. Time range: "Last hour" or "All time"
4. Click "Clear data"

**Or:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Option 2: Use Incognito/Private Mode
- Chrome: `Ctrl + Shift + N`
- Edge: `Ctrl + Shift + P`
- Firefox: `Ctrl + Shift + P`

### Option 3: Disable Cache in DevTools (For Development)
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Check "Disable cache"
4. Keep DevTools open while browsing

## Why This Happens

### Browser Cache Layers:
1. **Memory Cache**: Fast, temporary
2. **Disk Cache**: Persistent between sessions
3. **Service Worker Cache**: PWA cache
4. **HTTP Cache**: Based on Cache-Control headers

### What We Fixed:
✅ Server-side caching (Next.js)
✅ HTTP headers (Cache-Control)
✅ API response caching

### What Still Needs Manual Clear:
❌ Browser's existing cache (one-time clear needed)

## For End Users

When you deploy to production, users won't have this issue because:
1. They haven't visited the site before (no cache)
2. We've set proper cache headers for future visits
3. The cache will auto-clear after deployment (new build)

## For Development

### Best Practice:
1. **Always use DevTools with "Disable cache" enabled**
2. **Or use Incognito mode for testing**
3. **Clear cache after major changes**

### Why Not Auto-Clear?
- Can't programmatically clear browser cache (security restriction)
- Would require service worker (adds complexity)
- Manual clear is one-time per browser

## Verification

After clearing cache:
1. Open proposal page in normal tab
2. Refresh (F5) - should show correct data
3. Close tab, reopen - should still show correct data
4. No hard refresh needed anymore

## Technical Details

### Cache Headers We Set:
```
Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, max-age=0
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
```

### Next.js Settings:
```typescript
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
export const revalidate = 0;
export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store';
```

These prevent **future** caching, but don't clear **existing** cache.
