## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Data Flow
```
Product (master data)
    ↓
SupplierProduct (pricing & availability)
    ↓
ProductInstallationRequirement (labor costs)
    ↓
Quote Generation (final pricing)
```

### Key Relationships
- **Product → SupplierProduct**: One product, many suppliers
- **SupplierProduct → Supplier**: Each link has one supplier
- **Product → InstallationRequirement**: Products linked to labor types
- **InstallationLaborType → BaseRates**: Labor costs and multipliers

## 🎓 Understanding the System

### Products Model (Unified)
You're using a **single Product model** for all product types:
- `productType`: PANEL, INVERTER, BATTERY, RAILING, etc.
- `specifications`: JSON field for type-specific data
- No separate PanelBrand, BatteryBrand, InverterBrand tables

### Supplier-Product Catalog
The **SupplierProduct** table is your product catalog:
- Links products to suppliers
- Stores wholesale costs (`unitCost`)
- Tracks commission (`commissionAmount`, `markupPercent`)
- Manages stock (`stockLevel`, `stockStatus`)
- Calculates retail price automatically

### Installation Costing
Three interconnected tables:
1. **InstallationBaseRates**: Base fees and hourly rates
2. **InstallationLaborType**: Component installation costs
3. **InstallationComplexityFactor**: Multipliers and additions
4. **ProductInstallationRequirement**: Links products to labor
